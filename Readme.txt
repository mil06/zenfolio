This application takes input from a user and based on the contents of the input it will display some output. 

If the input is a sequence of numbers the output will contain the mean, median, mode, and range. Any special characters within the sequence will be considered as bad input, and the user will be prompted to enter another sequence or string.

If the input is a string, then we will determine the frequency of each letter and display the results. All spaces and non alpha characters will be ignored. Capital letters will be considered different than lowercase.
